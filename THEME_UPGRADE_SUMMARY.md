## New Theme System Features

### Three Theme Modes
1. **System** - Automatically follows device theme preference
2. **Light** - Always uses light theme
3. **Dark** - Always uses dark theme

### System Theme Detection
- Automatically detects device theme preference
- Listens for system theme changes
- Updates app theme in real-time when system theme changes

### Modern Color Palette
- **Primary**: Professional blue (#2563eb)
- **Secondary**: Slate gray (#64748b)
- **Success**: Emerald green (#10b981)
- **Warning**: Amber (#f59e0b)
- **Error**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Neutral**: Comprehensive gray scale

### Design System Integration
- All colors work seamlessly in both light and dark modes
- Proper contrast ratios maintained
- Consistent shadows and borders
- Smooth transitions between themes

## Usage Examples

### Setting Theme Programmatically
```typescript
// Set to system theme (default)
this.themeService.setThemeMode('system');

// Force light theme
this.themeService.setThemeMode('light');

// Force dark theme
this.themeService.setThemeMode('dark');
```

### Checking Current Theme
```typescript
// Get current theme mode
const mode = this.themeService.getThemeMode(); // 'system' | 'light' | 'dark'

// Check if dark mode is active
const isDark = this.themeService.isDarkMode();

// Get effective theme (system resolves to actual light/dark)
const effective = this.themeService.getEffectiveThemeMode(); // 'light' | 'dark'
```

### Using Theme Selector Component
```html
<app-theme-selector></app-theme-selector>
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can choose their preferred theme or follow system
2. **Modern Design**: Professional color palette and consistent theming
3. **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and readable text
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, organized theme system
5. **Performance**: Efficient theme switching with CSS custom properties
6. **Compatibility**: Works across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)

## Testing

To test the theme system:

1. **System Theme**: Change your device theme and verify the app follows
2. **Manual Override**: Use the theme selector to force light/dark mode
3. **Persistence**: Restart the app and verify theme preference is saved
4. **Real-time Updates**: Change system theme while app is running

## Next Steps

The theme system is now ready for testing. The old dark theme has been completely removed and replaced with a modern, flexible system that provides a much better user experience.
