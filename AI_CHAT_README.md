# AI Chat System - Lidapay

## Overview
The AI Chat system provides intelligent assistance for users with financial services including airtime purchases, money transfers, data bundles, and more. The system automatically falls back to local intelligent responses when OpenAI is not available.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Core Functionality
- **Smart Responses**: Context-aware responses based on user queries
- **Fallback System**: Local intelligence when OpenAI is unavailable
- **Quick Actions**: Pre-defined action buttons for common tasks
- **Suggestions**: Interactive suggestions based on AI responses
- **Voice Input**: Ready for voice input implementation (placeholder)

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- **Dual Mode**: OpenAI integration + Local fallback
- **Real-time Status**: Shows connection status (AI Connected vs Local AI)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with smooth animations
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile feedback for better user experience

## Configuration

### OpenAI Integration
To enable OpenAI integration, set your API key:

```typescript
// In your app initialization
import { AIService } from './services/ai.service';

constructor(private aiService: AIService) {}

// Set your OpenAI API key
this.aiService.setOpenAIApiKey('your-api-key-here');
```

### Environment Variables
You can also set the API key via environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Usage

### Basic Chat
Users can type messages and receive intelligent responses. The system automatically:
1. Detects the topic (airtime, money transfer, data, etc.)
2. Provides relevant information
3. Offers helpful suggestions
4. Falls back to local responses if needed

### Quick Actions
Users can click quick action buttons for:
- Buy Airtime
- Data Bundle
- Send Money
- Check Balance

### Suggestions
After each AI response, users see clickable suggestions that help them:
- Navigate to relevant services
- Get more specific information
- Complete their intended action

## Architecture

### Services
- **AIService**: Main service handling OpenAI and fallback responses
- **Fallback System**: Local intelligence with keyword matching
- **Response Generation**: Context-aware response selection

### Components
- **AiChatPage**: Main chat interface
- **TabsPage**: Modal management and integration
- **Quick Actions**: Interactive buttons for common tasks

## Fallback Responses

The system includes intelligent fallback responses for:

| Topic | Keywords | Responses |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Airtime | airtime, topup, recharge | Purchase guidance, network support |
| Money Transfer | transfer, send money, remittance | Transfer process, exchange rates |
| Data Bundles | data, internet, bundle | Data plans, pricing information |
| Wallet | wallet, balance, account | Balance checking, account management |
| Support | help, support, assist | General assistance, service overview |

## Customization

### Adding New Topics
To add new response categories:

```typescript
// In AIService
private fallbackResponses: FallbackResponse[] = [
  // ... existing responses
  {
    keywords: ['your', 'keywords'],
    responses: ['Your response 1', 'Your response 2'],
    suggestions: ['Suggestion 1', 'Suggestion 2']
  }
];
```

### Modifying Responses
Update the response arrays in the `AIService` to customize:
- Response text
- Keyword matching
- Suggested actions

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run start`
2. Navigate to the AI Chat tab
3. Test various queries to see fallback responses
4. Verify quick actions work correctly

### OpenAI Testing
1. Set a valid API key
2. Test with real queries
3. Verify fallback when API is unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chat not closing:**
- Check modal event handlers in `tabs.page.ts`
- Verify `closeChat` event emission

**Responses not working:**
- Check console for AI service errors
- Verify fallback responses are configured
- Check HTTP client configuration

**Quick actions not responding:**
- Verify `handleQuickAction` method exists
- Check button click handlers
- Ensure proper event binding

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:

```typescript
// In AIService
console.log('AI Service connection status:', this.isOpenAIConnected);
console.log('OpenAI request payload:', payload);
console.log('Fallback response generated:', response);
```
